# Multi-Model-Classifier
Automating model selection for classification problems in Machine Learning by comparing performance metrics across multiple models.

This project aims to streamline the process of model selection for classification problems in Machine Learning. Instead of manually trying out multiple models one by one, you can use this script to automatically run a variety of classification models on your dataset. 

The script currently supports the following models:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machines
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Naive Bayes
* Gradient Boosting
* Neural Networks

After running the script, you will receive a comprehensive report of each model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This will help you quickly identify the most effective model for your specific dataset and problem.

This project is designed to be easy to use, even for those new to Machine Learning. It's a great tool for both educational purposes and practical applications.
